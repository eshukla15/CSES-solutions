Think of DSU as a system of parents and children:

each element points to a parent
the parent points to its parent
...until you reach the root


find(x) = follow these pointers until you reach the root.

Then DSU does something clever called path compression:

it makes x point directly to the root


→ so next time, find(x) is O(1).

🟩 An example to understand DSU cleanly

Suppose you want to track which ticket indices are still available.

0 1 2 3 4 5  (available)


If someone buys ticket 4, you want to mark 4 as gone and next time redirect to 3.

DSU does this:

parent[4] = 3


If later 3 is gone:

parent[3] = 2


Now if someone asks for ticket 4:

find(4)
 → finds parent 3
 → finds parent 2
 → returns 2


And path compression updates:

parent[4] = 2


Next time find(4) returns in one step.

That is why DSU is so fast.
